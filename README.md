# AudioSequencer
Simple audio sequencer built with React and Web Audio API

##TODO
// re-draw circle with drag
// cb function for controller
// on-off light
// break down WaveMenu component
// spectrum visualization

//Update: there is no way to tell in chrome if an audionode is connected. hence need to change the clipper function to update the gain instead of connecting and disconnecting the node continuously.
