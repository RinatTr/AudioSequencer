# AudioSequencer
Simple audio sequencer built with React and Web Audio API

##TODO
// on / off button listener at WaveMenu
// connect X axis to clipper 

// cb function for controller
// on-off light
// break down WaveMenu component
// spectrum visualization

//Update: there is no way to tell in chrome if an audionode is connected. hence need to change the clipper function to update the gain instead of connecting and disconnecting the node continuously.

//NOTE: frequencies are a bit rounded to increase the chance of hitting a note in an attempt to compensate on the inaccuracy of the HTML slider.
